User-Agent will give the details on the client that initiated the request
Accept: This is accepting all types
Postman-Token is showing the token that was sent from Postman
Host is googleapis.com, hosting the request
Accept-Encoding will let us know which compressing method is okay to use
Connection is being kept alive

Content-type is letting us know that this is a json application using the UTF-8 character set
3 Vary response headers letting us know that origin, x-origin, and referer were used as representation for the resources 
Content-Encoding is gzip, 32 bit compression 
Date is time-stamping the request and response messages
Server is showing us that the software used for this was ESF
Cache-Control: private so the response is only being stored by the brokers cache
X-XSS-Protection 0 is being used to disable XSS filtering
X-Frame-Options is set to same origin so that the page can only be displayed in the same origin (I am assuming just postman)
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff is blocking style and script mime request types that are not text/css or javascript respectively
Alt-syc: advertising services that can reach the same resources. Done with the linked protocol/host/port combination
Transfer-Encoding: chunked is saying that the data needs to be chunked because of it’s size
